## Testing
### Unit testing
Kindly, install `Unit Test Boilerplate Generator` Extension from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RandomEngy.UnitTestBoilerplateGenerator) to generate boiler plates for the test cases.
Using NUnit is probably the way to go along with Moq, but other frameworks can also be used if preferred.

### End-to-End Testing
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro) is configured in the AgileMindsTest directory.

## Database
MySQL container
We can use MySQL Workbench to access it if needed.
